# Run the installer
# We simulate the git checkout by having the files already there
# But install.sh tries to clone. We can bypass the clone part if we modify it or
# we let it clone from the local directory.
# Actually, let's just run it and see if it can handle a local mock.

# To test the actual install.sh without needing a real repo URL at start,
# we can point it to the local directory or just run setup.sh directly.
# The user asked about install.sh, so let's try to make it work.

# We will run the install instructions from README/User request:
# curl -sSL ... | bash
# But since we are local, we can just run ./install.sh
